# CryptoClustering

This challenge combines Python and most prominently, unsupervised learning, in order to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 hour or 7 day price changes.

Data was prepared, and k-values were obtained based on the scaled data. k-means were used to cluster cryptocurrencies. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to optimise clusters. Following PCA, the best value for k was found. A second cluster was created following PCA, after which the two clusters were compared to each other.
